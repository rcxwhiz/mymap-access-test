Class registration is on March 1st

The two main features of this program are advanced filtering of the entire course catalogue and making a schedule
out of given classes.

# TODO warnings when classes aren't found - make just one entry in the column which says NOT FOUND
# TODO makes a schedule by getting all possible combinations and then removing the impossible ones
# TODO allow schedules to be optimized several ways
# TODO add a function to the semester manager to save it to a google sheet

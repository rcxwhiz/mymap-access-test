Class registration is on March 1st

The two main features of this program are advanced filtering of the entire course catalogue and making a schedule
out of given classes.

# TODO a good GUI so that the filtering can be done well
# TODO a function to update the class catalogue
# TODO a cached catalogue (json?) with a timestamp of when it was collected
# TODO a dropdown to select the semester
# TODO determine if filter will be able to apply in realtime due to performance issues or if an apply button is needed

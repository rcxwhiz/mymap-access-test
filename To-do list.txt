Class registration is on March 1st

The two main features of this program are advanced filtering of the entire course catalogue and making a schedule
out of given classes.

# TODO a good GUI so that the filtering can be done well
# TODO a dropdown to select the semester
# TODO determine if filter will be able to apply in realtime due to performance issues or if an apply button is needed
# TODO warnings when classes aren't found - make just one entry in the column which says NOT FOUND
# TODO makes a schedule by getting all possible combinations and then removing the impossible ones
# TODO allow schedules to be optimized several ways
# TODO add a function to the semester manager to save it to a google sheet
# TODO make pickles widget show when button is pressed
# TODO check on table population because there is an empty column
# TODO I think the semester filtering should be done on the end of the semester manager, and it should just have a filtered list it gives
# TODO make the time and credit adjustors keep each other in check

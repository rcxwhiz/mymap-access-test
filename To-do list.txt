Class registration is on March 1st

The two main features of this program are advanced filtering of the entire course catalogue and making a schedule
out of given classes.

# TODO click on course in advanced search and get a look at the details of all of its sections, similar to in scheduling
# TODO search by description
# TODO it may only be required to click the class button again when a class loading gets stuck
# TODO deleting and refreshing from pickles page doesn't really work
# TODO the full ui class could probably use to have several functions split off of it
# TODO it would probably be best to have a blacklist/whitelist option for the day/time scheduling
